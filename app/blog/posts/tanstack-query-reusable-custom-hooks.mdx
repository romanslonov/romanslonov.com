Since the release of TanStack Query v5, many people have faced issues with reusing custom hooks. In this article, I will show you how to solve this problem.

## Problem

When you try to wrap your useQuery into a custom hook and define options as an argument with `UseQueryOptions` type, you will get an error when you try to pass some options in it:

> `Property 'queryKey' is missing in type '{ staleTime: number; refetchOnWindowFocus: false; }' but required in type 'UseQueryOptions<Post, Error, Post, QueryKey>'.ts(2345)`

## Solution #1

You can `Omit` `queryKey` and `queryFn` from `UseQueryOptions` type like that:

```ts
import { type UseQueryOptions, useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { type Post, getPost } from '@/entities/post';

export function usePost(
  id: number,
  options?: Omit<UseQueryOptions<Post>, 'queryKey' | 'queryFn'>,
) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['post', id],
    queryFn: () => getPost(id).then((response) => response.post),
    ...options,
  });
}
```

Now the error is gone and you can pass any options you want with autocompletion.

## Solution #2

You can define in `options` specific ones you really needed like so:

```ts
import { type UseQueryOptions, useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { type Post, getPost } from '@/entities/post';

export function usePost(
  id: number,
  options?: {
    // just a few for example
    staleTime?: UseQueryOptions<Post>['staleTime'];
    refetchOnWindowFocus?: UseQueryOptions<Post>['refetchOnWindowFocus'];
  },
) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['post', id],
    queryFn: () => getPost(id).then((response) => response.post),
    ...options,
  });
}
```

Thats it! Now you can reuse your custom hooks with any options you want. I show example in React but it also works in Vue, etc.
